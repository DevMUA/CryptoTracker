<h1>CryptoTracker:</h1>

CryptoTracker is an application that receives its information from CoinGecko API and over time stores the information in a Kafka Broker that is later consumed by the backend to be
stored in a database. The system will then use that information to pass it to the machine learning module that will make predictions, that information will then be exposed in a REST API
to be used by the frontend interface.
